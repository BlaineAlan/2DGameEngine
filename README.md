# 2DGameEngine

The goal with this project is to create a 2D game engine that can be used to create simple 2D games. 

1. First make the engine

2. Make a game on it (probably pong)

Heres the website I'm using to learn SDL2:

# Running

    make all

Compiles engine.cpp and creates an executable called ./engine

    ./engine

Runs the program

# Progress

So far the demo can open a window, loading a simple image at default. When hitting the arrow keys it will change the image. Hitting the 'x' will close the program.
